# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs. Resolve an ambiguous `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, then fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Skill operations

- When a skill says **publish to the issue tracker**, create a GitHub issue.
- When a skill says **fetch the relevant ticket**, run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

- A map is one issue labelled `wayfinder:map`; its tickets are GitHub sub-issues where available.
- Use GitHub native issue dependencies for blocking edges. Fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>` line when dependencies are unavailable.
- A ticket is unblocked when all blockers are closed.
- Claim work with `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me` before the first write.
- Resolve work by commenting with the answer, closing the issue, and recording its context pointer on the map.
